Iris Flower Species Classification

The Iris flower dataset, introduced by Ronald Fisher in 1936, comprises 150 records across 5 attributes: Petal Length, Petal Width, Sepal Length, Sepal Width, and Class (Species). Edgar Anderson collected the data to analyze the morphologic variation of Iris flowers, encompassing three species: Iris Setosa, Iris Virginica, and Iris Versicolor. This dataset has since become a benchmark for statistical classification techniques in machine learning, including support vector machines.

Challenge Overview:-

In this challenge, the goal is to classify Iris flower species based on their morphologic features such as petal and sepal dimensions.

Dataset:-

The dataset used for this analysis contains 150 records of Iris flowers, with 5 attributes: Petal Length, Petal Width, Sepal Length, Sepal Width, and Class (Species).

Analysis:-

We will explore the dataset to understand patterns and relationships between the morphologic features and the species of Iris flowers. Then, we will build a classification model to predict the species based on the given features.
