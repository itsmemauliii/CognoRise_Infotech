# Car Price Prediction Project

## Project Overview

Welcome to the Car Price Prediction project! The main objective of this project is to develop predictive models that can accurately forecast car prices based on various features such as brand reputation, car features, horsepower, mileage efficiency, and more.
Numerous factors contribute to a car's price, encompassing brand reputation, car features, horsepower, mileage efficiency, and more. Car price prediction stands as a significant domain within machine learning
research.If you seek to master the art of training a car price prediction model, this project presents a valuable learning opportunity.

## Algorithms Used

- Linear Regression
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis contains a comprehensive set of car data, including information on brand, features, horsepower, mileage efficiency, and price. It comprises X records with Y attributes.

## Analysis

In this project, we explore the dataset to identify patterns and relationships between car features and prices. We preprocess the data, perform feature engineering, and split it into training and testing sets. Then, we train multiple machine learning models using algorithms like Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting to predict car prices.
